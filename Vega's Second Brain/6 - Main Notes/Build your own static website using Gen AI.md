# Build your own static website using Gen AI

A static website is an application that contains fixed content and displays the same information to every visitor. 
 - It does not have any changing elements (no matter how many times you refresh, the content wont change, unlike Instagram etc.)
 - These websites involve limited user interactions, and each page is primarily developed using HTML and CSS.

To use Gen AI, we need to use prompt engineering so we have to plan beforehand for what we want.

Prompt:

Write HTML and CSS code to transform the given mockup into a colorful developer portfolio website as per the guidelines. The developer name should be Vega Darsi.

1. Give the HTML and CSS code separately.
2. If images are required, use image links from Unsplash that fits the design.
3. Create a modern, clean design with a layout that works well with both laptop and mobile devices.
4. Include animations and transitions that enhance the users experience.
