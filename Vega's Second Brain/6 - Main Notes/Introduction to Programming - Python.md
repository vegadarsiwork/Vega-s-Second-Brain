# Introduction to Programming - Python



Procedure oriented programming - **a programming model derived from structural programming**. It follows the concept of the calling procedure. The procedures, also called functions, routines, or subroutines, consist of a series of computational steps that they need to carry out. e.g C language

Object oriented programming - **a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic**. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. e.g Python, C++, C#, etc.

Why learn python? - very versatile language with applications in almost every field.

# Day 2 - Variables and Data Types

Variables
Data Types - int, float, string, boolean
Assignment Operator

examples of variable names - Sport, age, height, past participation
examples of values stored -     Cricket, 17, 6'1, Yes
Variables are like containers for storing values.

| Data Type      | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integer (int)  | Any whole number. i.e. 3                                             |
| Float          | Any number including decimals i.e. 3.0, 12.7                         |
| String (str)   | Any text, declared by being wrapped in quotation marks i.e. “Hello!” |
| Boolean (bool) | Only has two possible values, true or false.                         |
Statically typed language - need to assign value to variable with data type mentioned
Dynamically typed language - no need to specify used data type.
